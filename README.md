# typescript-starting-project

Start a new typescript project easily, the entire project is recompiled automatically on file save, also all files are uglified and minified:)

# Install packages and gulp client
``
npm install -g gulp-cli && npm install
``

# Run
Just execute the command ``gulp`` and it will start the default task (compiling all *.ts from src folder into one JS file in build folder)
